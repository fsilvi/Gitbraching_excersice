EASY KIMCHI 

Definitely one of our favourite condiments! For those who do not know what kimchi is, it is like a korean style sauerkraut with a wonderful spicy tangy gingery flavour. Goes great with everything, it is packed full of probiotics great for digestion and the immune system. This recipe was developed by Fiona, our wonderful fermenter, through lots of experimenting. Traditionally Kimchi is made using chinese cabbage but we adapted to make it quicker and easier and still taste fab! For a more traditional style kim chi check out the recipe on page x x Its great to make in a big batch as it lasts for a long time and the longer you let it ferment the more healthy gut bacteria start to develop and the flavours just get more developed. This does take time to make but itâ€™s so worth it.

INGREDIENTS
1 kg Mixed Veg such carrot, pak choi, chinese cabbage, radish, leek, beet 
20 g salt Sauce 
4 tbsp Tamari 
1 tsp maple syrup 
25 g rice flour 
200 ml water 
5 cloves garlic
1/2 onion 
1/2 tsp kelp powder 
2.5 tbs gochugaru (1 tbsp sweet paprika & 1.5 tbsp chilli powder/ cayenne powder) 

INSTRUCTIONS
Roughly chop the veg, remembering it should be bite sized. Put in a large bowl or sauce pan and add the salt and mix well and bash with a saucer for 2 mins. Leave to sit for 1-2 hours or even overnight. Rinse and wash the salt away and put back in the bowl/ sauce pan. Peel the garlic cloves. Add the ingredients for the sauce and blend till smooth. Pour over the already salted veg and add the gochugaru or paprika/ chilli mix and mix well. Add to your jar or vessel for fermentation. Ensure it's submerged under the sauce and natural veg juices as this is a lactic acid fermentation process. Leave to ferment on the counter for 2-3 days until it starts to become more bubbly. Taste and if you prefer it to be more acidic, leave for longer. The longer you leave it to ferment at room temperature the more acidic it will become. Once you are happy with the level of acidity put in the fridge and enjoy for many months or years to follow. Points of note Check on your kimchi every few days, to make sure that the veg stays submerged in the liquid. Sometimes, the top layer that is exposed to the air can start to go off slightly but don't worry about this, it can simply be scraped off and the underneath layer should still be perfectly fine to eat. Time and temperature are the 2 secret ingredients for fermentation, the longer you leave it ferment the stronger and more acidic the flavour, also the warmed the temperature the quicker it will ferment.
